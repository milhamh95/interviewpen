# O(log n) logarithmic time
- as the input increases double, the number of operations increase by 1
- 2 ^ 3 = 8
- log 8 = 3
- example: 16 -> how many times we need multiply 2 until reach 16
  - or how many times I can divide 16 until I can't divide it anymore
  - 16 / 2 = 8
  - 8 / 2 = 4
  - 4 / 2 = 2
  - 2 / 2 = 1
