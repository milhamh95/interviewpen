### a. Reverse All Number
- Time complexity: O(log 10 n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

### b. Reverse Half Number
- Time complexity: O(log 10 n)
- Space complexity: O(1)

- we're working with decimal number, base 10
- so we use log base 10
- we can ignore base number (10,2), because in time complexity we only care about the growth / scale of the algorithm as the input size grows very large
